Ernie Bot, which stands for \u0026ldquo;Enhanced Representation from kNowledge IntEgration,\u0026rdquo; can solve math problems, write marketing copy, answer questions about Chinese literature, and generate multimedia responses. According to Baidu\u0026rsquo;s CEO, Robin Li, Ernie Bot performs particularly well on tasks specific to Chinese culture, such as explaining historical facts or writing traditional poems.\nThe highlight of Ernie Bot\u0026rsquo;s release is its multimodal output feature, which ChatGPT and OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s recently announced GPT-4 do not offer. Ernie Bot can generate illustrations, read out text answers, and even edit and subtitle videos based on text inputs. However, there have been reports that some of the features showcased during the product launch, specifically the video generation, have failed to be reproduced in later testing. Despite this setback, Baidu\u0026rsquo;s Ernie Bot is an exciting addition to the growing list of large language models and highlights the increasing emphasis on multimodal capabilities in AI language models.\nGPT-4. 4 We\u0026rsquo;ve technically already seen the release of GPT-4 more than 5 weeks ago. OpenAI says GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations. GPT-4’s capability is impressive, from being able to produce the code for a hand-sketched website, to creating content that passed the completely human check of GPT Zero, and confusing OpenAI’s LLM text classifier. Unfortunately, due to security and competition reasons, OpenAI stated in their GPT-4 technical report that it contains no further details about the architecture , hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar.GPT-4’s text-generation speed is significantly slower than the current free version of ChatGPT.\nMaximizing Collaboration and Productivity with Innovative Chat Plugins. 5 Chat plugins are computer programmes that enhance the usefulness of chat programmes by adding new features and functionalities.

It can even be conditioned on both text and melody, meaning that it can transform whistled or hummed melodies into a specific style described in the text caption.\nTo support future research, Google AI has released MusicCaps, a dataset of 5.5k music-text pairs, with text descriptions written by human experts. This dataset is sure to be a valuable resource for music researchers and enthusiasts alike.\nEmpowering Home Assistants with Human-Like Interaction: The Next Step in AI Evolution. 4 MIT researchers have developed the NOPA framework, a system that allows AI agents to autonomously determine the best way to assist human users at different times. NOPA enables the creation of more responsive and socially intelligent robots and home assistants by simultaneously inferring what task the human user is trying to tackle and appropriately assisting them without waiting for explicit instructions from the human. The framework uses a neural network to continuously predict a set of possible goals for the human user, which are then evaluated and updated. The AI assistant uses inverse planning to search for common subgoals and specific actions that can help humanity achieve its goals. The researchers evaluated NOPA in a simulated environment and found that agents were able to adjust their behavior to minimize disruption, such as putting back objects they picked if they were not related to the task.\nBuzzFeed Boosts Business with OpenAI: Embracing the Future of AI-Assisted Content Creation. 5 BuzzFeed\u0026rsquo;s shares rose by 120% bringing the company\u0026rsquo;s market value to $300 million after it announced plans to use OpenAI to enhance its content creation, including its quizzes. OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s publicly available API will be used by BuzzFeed and this move toward AI-assisted content comes as OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s viral chatbot, ChatGPT, has gained popularity and sparked a debate over AI\u0026rsquo;s role in the workplace.

This makes it particularly well-suited for translation, machine writing, and language modeling tasks in languages that do not use spaces between words.\nOne of the key benefits of ChatGPT is its ability to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words more effectively than traditional word-based language models. In a word-based model, OOV words can be a significant problem because they are not part of the model\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary and therefore difficult to process. ChatGPT, on the other hand, can handle OOV words by treating them as a sequence of individual characters, allowing it to generate more accurate and coherent text.\nAnother advantage of ChatGPT is its ability to handle languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, such as inflection and word concatenation. In these languages, a single word can have multiple meanings depending on its inflection, and word boundaries may not always be clearly defined. ChatGPT is able to handle this complexity by processing text at the character level, allowing it to generate more accurate and natural-sounding text in these languages.\nDifferential privacy: Preserving individual privacy in a world of data sharing. 2 Differential privacy is a concept in the field of computer science that refers to the practice of protecting the privacy of individuals in a dataset by adding noise to the data before it is analyzed. This noise helps to obscure the data of individual users, making it more difficult to identify or profile specific individuals within the dataset.\nDifferential privacy (DP) is a framework for measuring the privacy of an algorithm. It does this by quantifying the \u0026ldquo;privacy cost\u0026rdquo; of the algorithm, which refers to the amount of information about an individual that is leaked as a result of running the algorithm.\nComposition is a key property of DP that reflects the net privacy cost of a combination of DP algorithms when they are viewed as a single algorithm. An example of this is the differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm, which trains machine learning models over multiple iterations, each of which is differentially private. The basic composition theorem in DP states that the privacy cost of a collection of algorithms is, at most, the sum of the privacy cost of each individual algorithm. However, this can often be a gross overestimate, and several improved composition theorems have been developed to provide better estimates of the privacy cost of composition. These theorems help to more accurately understand the privacy cost of a combination of DP algorithms and ensure that it does not exceed certain thresholds.\nEHR-Safe: Realistic EHR data for research and analysis, without compromising patient privacy. 3 EHR-Safe is a tool for generating synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) that are both high-fidelity and privacy-preserving. It is designed to allow researchers and analysts to work with real-world EHR data without exposing the sensitive personal information of individual patients.\nOne of the key features of EHR-Safe is its ability to generate synthetic EHRs that are indistinguishable from real EHRs. This is achieved through the use of advanced machine learning techniques that are trained on real EHR data. The resulting synthetic EHRs are able to capture the structure, variability, and complexity of real EHRs, making them an ideal tool for research and analysis.\nIn addition to its ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic EHRs, EHR-Safe is also designed to protect the privacy of individual patients. It does this through the use of differential privacy techniques, which add noise to the data in order to obscure the data of individual patients. This helps to ensure that the sensitive personal information of individual patients is not exposed while still allowing researchers to work with real-world EHR data.\nRT-1: Revolutionizing robotics with flexible, adaptable, and autonomous models. 4 Recent advances in machine learning (ML) research, such as computer vision and natural language processing, have been enabled by the use of large, diverse datasets and expressive models. However, this approach has not yet been successfully applied to robotics due to a lack of large-scale and diverse robotic data and the lack of expressive, scalable, and fast models that can learn from this data and generalize effectively. Data collection for robotics is particularly expensive and challenging, and there is a need for more expressive and fast models that can learn from this data in real-time.\nRobotics Transformer 1 (RT1) aims to revolutionize the field of robotics by enabling the development of robots that are more flexible, adaptable, and autonomous based on the transformer architecture.\nKey features of RT1: ability to process a wide range of sensory inputs, including visual, auditory, and tactile data. This allows it to perceive and interact with its environment in a more natural and intuitive way, making it better suited for tasks such as object recognition and manipulation. ability to adapt to changing environments and tasks. It is able to learn from experience and make adjustments to its behavior in order to better accomplish its goals. This makes it more flexible and adaptable than many traditional robotics systems, which are typically hard-coded to perform specific tasks.\nCICERO: Empowering human-AI cooperation through negotiation and persuasion. 5 CICERO is an AI agent that has achieved human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy. CICERO demonstrated this by ranking in the top 10% of participants on webDiplomacy.net, an online version of the game. CICERO\u0026rsquo;s success in Diplomacy is notable because it requires players to understand other people\u0026rsquo;s motivations and perspectives, make complex plans, and use natural language to negotiate and form alliances with other players. CICERO is so effective at using natural language to negotiate in the game that other players often preferred working with it over other human participants.\nhttps://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/differential-privacy-accounting-by.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/ehr-safe-generating-high-fidelity-and.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/rt-1-robotics-transformer-for-real.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-december-2022/Poster_hu_dfb1e293277aa20a.png","permalink":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-december-2022/","title":"This Month in AI - December 2022"},{"content":"We are pleased to announce that we are conducting a workshop on Kaggle Competetions.

The performance of NLP tasks has been improved by scaling up language models. Scaling up LMs required a great number of computational resources.\nThe researchers have explored two complementary approaches for improving existing language models which are \u0026ldquo;Transcending Scaling Laws with 0.1% Extra Compute\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Scaling Instruction-Fine Tuned Language Models\u0026rdquo;. In the First method, they introduced UL2R which improves performance across a range of NLP tasks in “Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models”, they explore fine-tuning a language model on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions, a process they call “Flan”.\nCompute versus model performance of PaLM 540B and U-PaLM 540B on 26 NLP benchmarks (listed in Table 8 in the paper). U-PaLM 540B continues training PaLM for a very small amount of compute but provides a substantial gain in performance. Google researchers show that Flan and UL2R can be combined as a model called Flan-U-PaLM 540B. As LMs become even larger, techniques such as UL2R and Flan that improve general performance without large amounts of compute may become increasingly attractive.\nIn machine learning, the use of synthetic data improves the performance of a models 2 Researchers train machine learning models using vast datasets of video clips that show humans performing actions. Using these videos might also violate copyright or data protection laws.\nSo, researchers have come up with a solution instead of using realistic datasets they are turning to use synthetic datasets. These are made by a computer that uses 3D models of scenes, objects, and humans to quickly produce many varying clips of specific actions and this type of data does not violate copyright.\nTo test whether the synthetic data works as good as real data researchers used 150,000 synthetic datasets that captured a wide range of human actions to train machine-learning models. The researchers found that the synthetically trained models performed even better than models trained on real data for videos that have fewer background objects.\nAWS Machine Learning University is now providing a new program 3 AWS Machine Learning University is now providing a new program that will help institutions serving historically underserved and underrepresented students deliver courses in next-gen tech with a free, comprehensive educator-enablement bootcamp and a curriculum based on the same courses Amazon uses to train its own developers and data scientists.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) Machine Learning University is now launching a free program helping community colleges teach databases, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning concepts.

HCC will be the first community college in the U.S. to offer a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in AI in fall 2023 pending final approval from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.\nAI will thrive in 3 key areas in 2023, despite economic conditions 4 Some of the biggest tech names have laid off artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning employees this fall. AI experts expect AI innovation to continue, even in the midst of a possible recession. \u0026ldquo;AI will continue to be central to business by cutting costs and increasing innovation,\u0026rdquo; they say.\n\u0026ldquo;AI won\u0026rsquo;t replace humans in the near term,\u0026rdquo; said Vishal Sikka, founder, and CEO of human-centered AI platform, Vian AI. In 2023, the recognition that too many platforms aren\u0026rsquo;t designed for humans to use will increase. More and more systems will be designed to amplify human judgment.\nUse of AI to Better prepare for climate migration 5 Climate change is one of the scariest crises of our time causing natural disasters that often result in the displacement of large groups of people, known as ‘climate migrants.’ According to the United Nations International Organization for Migration, up to one billion people will become climate migrants over the next three decades. This projection rises to 1.2 billion by 2050 and 1.4 billion by 2060.\nThe responsible use of AI offers a unique perspective into climate migration that can benefit climate migrants and states alike. Current data sources include national authorities, NGOs and IGOs and administrative data sources, such as humanitarian visa numbers. However, these are often updated after a disaster happens and do not reflect the urgency of the matter at hand. The use of AI as a predictive and preventative mechanism allows individuals and governments to make the necessary preparations before a natural disaster strikes.\nA far-sighted approach to machine learning 6 A new technique enables artificial intelligence agents to think much farther into the future when considering how their behaviors can influence the behaviors of other AI agents, toward the completion of a task. This approach improves long-term performance of cooperative or competitive AI agents.\nCreating artificial intelligence agents that can learn to compete and cooperate as effectively as humans remains a thorny problem. Because of the complexity of this problem, current approaches tend to be myopic; the agents can only guess the next few moves of their teammates or competitors, which leads to poor performance in the long run. Their machine-learning framework enables cooperative or competitive AI agents to consider what other agents will do as time approaches infinity, not just over a few next steps.\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/better-language-models-without-massive.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2022/synthetic-data-ai-improvements-1103\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-launches-new-ai-program-for-community-colleges-msis-hbcus\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-will-thrive-in-3-areas-despite-economic-conditions-experts-say/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/how-ai-can-help-climate-migration/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/11/221123114212.htm\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-november-2022/Poster_hu_6bf7955ab697d053.jpg","permalink":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-november-2022/","title":"This Month in AI - November 2022"},{"content":"Learn how to start building, shipping, and maintaining software with Git \u0026amp; GitHub.

Improving the quality of our language models is a key target for researchers to make progress toward such a goal.\nAn overview of the denoising objectives used in UL2’s mixture-of-denoisers. AI can detect drunkenness by evaluating infrared images of human faces with 93% accuracy 3 Artificial intelligence has developed a way to detect whether a person is drunk or not using thermal imaging. The technology could be used by police to screen people in city centers or at events where alcohol is likely to have been consumed. Thermal imaging offers a less ambiguous approach that is also non-invasive, researchers say.\nAny system designed to identify inebriated people must have a very low rate of false positives and false negatives. After all, a false negative might see a drunk person driving their car whereas too many false positives would lead to frustration and a loss of trust in the system among the public.\nAn open-source image database that unlocks the power of AI for ocean exploration 4 Fathom Net is an open-source image database that uses state-of-the-art data processing algorithms to help process the backlog of visual data. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning will alleviate the bottleneck for analyzing underwater imagery and accelerate important research around ocean health.\nRecent advances in machine learning enable fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data. Still, the use of AI in ocean research has been limited by the lack of a standard set of existing images that could be used to train the machines to recognize and catalog underwater objects and life. This will surely help in ocean cleaning.\nLabeled image data for deep learning algorithms require an annotation and localization for a single concept. How AI image generators could help robots 5 The field of AI-generated art can be traced back as far as the 1960s with early attempts using symbolic rule-based approaches to make technical images. The way these generative models generate images: initially, you have this really nice image, where you start from this random noise, and you basically learn how to simulate the process of how to reverse this process of going from noise back to your original image, where you try to iteratively refine this image to make it more and more realistic.\nResearchers have been working on extending stable diffusion models, the technical backbone of generative art to other domains such as robotics. The researchers describe how these models can work wrt to robotics: as you can generate different images, you can also generate different robot trajectories (the path and schedule), and by composing different models together, you are able to generate trajectories with different combinations of skills. If I have natural language specifications of jumping versus avoiding an obstacle, you could also compose these models together, and then generate robot trajectories that can both jump and avoid an obstacle.\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/15/1059550/an-ai-that-can-design-new-proteins-could-help-unlock-new-cures-and-materials/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2022/10/ul2-20b-open-source-unified-language.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-ai-network-drunkenness-infrared-images.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-open-source-image-database-power-ai.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2022-10-ai-image-robots.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-october-2022/Poster_hu_2c6969a21884db8.jpg","permalink":"https://mind-benders.github.io/blog/p/tmai-october-2022/","title":"This Month in AI - October 2022"},{"content":"The Club is conducting a webinar on Kaggle.

It will democratize state-of-the-art tools, libraries, and other components to make these innovations accessible to everyone.\nPyTorch was created by a group of Meta AI researchers to fix the tedious, complicated pipeline of the AI field. Meta will continue to invest in the framework, and use it as the primary framework for our AI research and production. The framework will continue to be a part of Meta\u0026rsquo;s AI research and engineering work.\nPyTorch Foundation will focus on the business and product marketing of PyTorch and the related ecosystem The EU wants to put companies on the hook for harmful AI 9 The EU is creating new rules to make it easier to sue AI companies for harm. A bill unveiled this week is likely to become law in a couple of years. The bill would give people and companies the right to sue for damages after being harmed by an AI system. It will add teeth to the EU\u0026rsquo;s AI Act, which is set to become law around the same time.\nWhether or not it succeeds, this new EU legislation will have a ripple effect on how AI is regulated around the world. The EU wants to be the global gold standard for AI regulation. Other countries, such as the US, are considering similar regulations. The Federal Trade Commission is considering rules around how companies handle data and build algorithms.

Potentially billions of molecules can produce a smell, so figuring out which ones produce which smells is difficult to catalog or predict. Sensory maps can help us solve this problem, and have existed for centuries, but not for smell. The model works by exploring thousands of examples of distinct molecules paired with the smell labels that they evoke, e.g., \u0026ldquo;beefy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;floral\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;minty\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Principal Odor Map is a map that maps molecules chemical character.

Day by day, the information surrounding us increases, bombarding us with bits only to be forgotten or missed leaving us completely overwhelmed in the process .\nBy collecting \u0026amp; organizing the data, we have built tools to build models and generate AI that have started to pop in the real world. Lots of people consider AI as an evolutionary change in human life, which is quite debatable. But collecting knowledge about all the new changes is still possible for us.\nThus, The Month in AI Blog Series aims to summarize newest trends \u0026amp; research breakthroughs that will shape the world of AI.\nThe Meta AI : Greater creative control for AI image generation 1 Meta AI published the AI research concept known as Make-A-Scene.

For example, it could be used to produce smart shoes that track the gait of someone who is learning to walk again after an injury, or socks that monitor pressure on a diabetic patient’s foot to prevent the formation of ulcers.\nML-Enhanced Code Completion Improves Developer Productivity 3 Today we describe how we combined ML and SE to develop a novel Transformer-based hybrid semantic ML code completion, now available to internal Google developers.\nThe increasing complexity of code poses a key challenge to productivity in software engineering. Code completion has been an essential tool that has helped mitigate this complexity in integrated development environments (IDEs).\nIntegrated full line completions by ML continuing the semantic dropdown completion that is in focus. Suggestions of multiple line completions by ML. A common approach to code completion is to train transformer models, which use a self-attention mechanism for language understanding, to enable code understanding and completion predictions. We treat code similar to language, represented with sub-word tokens and a SentencePiece vocabulary, and use encoder-decoder transformer models running on TPUs to make completion predictions. The input is the code that is surrounding the cursor (~1000-2000 tokens) and the output is a set of suggestions to complete the current or multiple lines. Sequences are generated with a beam sea rch (or tree exploration) on the decoder.\nDALL·E 2 - OpenAI 4 The artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI revealed DALL·E 2, the successor to 2021’s DALL·E.
