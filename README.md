This repo is part of Mind Benders Club's Github Blog.

It has submodules: themes/hugo-theme-stack, content, First-Contribution.

The repo contains all the changes files changed over the original theme. 

Most of the changes are done by using Custom files that will add/overwrite the themes files when the website it built. 

The bits required for SW.js were taken from jeremylikness blog, so a big thanks to him.
Icons have been taken from Tabler Icons.
